# Predicting trends in home sale prices
## DSI Capstone: James Chiu 

### Goals: 
Whether you are a real estate investor, homeowner, renter or government, housing is a part of the economy that affects everybody. 
- How do we make informed decisions about a basic need? 
  * In order to make an informed decision, we look at past trends and the current condition of the market. 
- How can we predict trends in the housing market? 
  * The way to predicts trends in the housing market requires a look at pricing data. This is because prices have imbedded information about the demand and temperature of a market. 
- Can we use time series data to predict the price of a house? 
  * After obtaining pricing data for the sales price of a house market, the next step action steps are to make predictions based on inference from the information.  

The primary goal of this capstone is to predict future home sales price 1-6 months ahead. This project will also look at other factors that may have an effect. Answering the quesion, does adding features relevant to the economy as a whole affect the accuracy of the model? In order to make informed decisions the following data that affect markets as a whole will be analyzed: CPI, Fed Funds Rate and Unemployment Rate.

### Data: 
The time series data was collected from 2 primary sources. This includes Zillow, a website for real estate information and the St. Louis Federal Reserve, a website that provides economic data.
