# Predicting trends in home sale prices
## DSI Capstone: James Chiu 

### Goals: 
Whether you are a real estate investor, homeowner, renter or government, housing is a part of the economy that affects everybody. 
How do we make informed decisions about a basic need? 
How can we predict trends in the housing market? 
Can we use time series data to predict the price of a house?

Eg. CPI, Fed Funds Rate, Unemployment Rate
